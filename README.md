# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


MVP
- Create a page that allows users to search for books Page should include the following:
- Header section introducing the page
- Form containing a text input and a submit / search button

A grid of books Instructions:
- When the submit button is clicked you need the request books from the Google books API using the input value as your query string
- The books that you receive should be rendered in the books grid.
- Each book in the grid should have an image, author, title and description
- The grid should be responsive on different screen sizes
- You should use async / await for your request code, NOT .then
(.then is okay in a useEffect though)
- You may want to seperate your request code from component code

Styling (required):
- This application should look good, take some time to pick a palette and plan out your design - this will also help with splitting the app into React components. You can use tools like Figma or wireframe pro to plan what your application is going to look like.
- Use modules for styling, don't forget about other SCSS features, like a separate file for palette or variables.

Application Design (required):
- Remember that some JavaScript logic, like functions that fetch data, can be moved to their own .js files
- Always use iterators over loops
- Always parametrize and abstract large pieces of duplicate code.

Bonus (optional, but highly recommended):
- Give feedback to the user when no book results can be found for the query.âœ…
- When a user clicks a book in the grid, a modal should appear with more book information, think about release, publish date, country, languages, etc.
